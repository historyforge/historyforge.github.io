            <p>Early stages of development of History Forge were made possible by a generous contribution from Dryden Mutual Insurance Company, Robert B. Baxter, CEO and General Manager, with additional support from the Triad Foundation, the Tompkins County Bicentennial Commission, and the trustees of The History Center in Tompkins County. </p>
            <p>HistoryForge is now supported by a two-year grant for Public Engagement with Historical Records from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) of the National Archives (NARA). The grant has allowed us to make major improvements to the interface and add significant content, while also refining the open source model by engaging partners to test all aspects of the project. HistoryForge is actively recruiting partners throughout the country.</p>
            <p>Does your business have a sense of place and an interest in history? Please consider sponsoring HistoryForge.</p>
